# About
This document summarizes estimates of change in mature individuals over time for Pacific salmon Designatable Unit (DU) and associated  probable COSEWIC status designation. Data sources are detailed [here](https://github.com/Pacific-salmon-assess/COSEWIC-prioritize#data-sources) and all code to reproduce the analyses in this document is [here](https://github.com/Pacific-salmon-assess/COSEWIC-prioritize). These materials are solely intended to support the Marine Fishes sub-committee of COSEWIC in identifying high priority DUs for COSEWIC to consider when conducting formal status assessments.

# Prioritization decison nodes
Initial thoughts on potential decision nodes in the prioritization process. 

#. **Have DUs been formally defined by COSEWIC?** Chinook, sockeye, and coho salmon DUs have been defined (reports available [here](https://www.cosewic.ca/index.php/en-ca/reports/special-reports.html)), formal pink and chum DU identification is in progress. If **yes** then proceed. 

#. **Is information on mature individuals over time available at the DU scale?** If **yes** then proceed.

#. **Has DU been previously assessed by COSEWIC?** If **yes** then consider a re-assessment, otherwise proceed.

#. **What is the DUs probable designation based on percentage change in mature individuals over past three generations?** If **special concern**,  **threatened** or **endangered** then proceed.

#. **Are there spatial considerations?** Are there commonalities in threats, designations, and/or data landscape at a regional scale that suggest a group of DUs should be bundled together?
